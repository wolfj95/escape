        Welcome to the CS10 Web Design escape room! Over the past few classes, you have
        been learning about how website are built using HTML and CSS. You've seen how
        some fairly simple tools can make really interesting, unique, and complex websites.
      </p>
      <p>Now, you're going to use that knowledge of how the web is built to escape from
      this digital escape room. Each new webage you find will present a puzzle for
      you to solve using the things you know about HTML and CSS. Sometimes, these
      puzzles will be based on what you can see on the page. However, sometime the
      puzzles will require you to think outside of the box and poke around a bit.
      </p>
      <p>To get out of each "room" (webpage) of this escape room, you will need to 
      find (or figure out) a password. Once you have that password, you can use it
      to move on to the next page by appending it to the URL (remember that websites
      are just collections of HTML files in folders on a server somewhere. If you know
      the address of that file, you can access it). For example, if you think that
      the password hidden in this room is "password", you should enter 
      <a href="password">escape.wolfie.dev/password</a> into the URL bar.
      Then, if in the next room you think the password is "computer", you should enter 
      <a href="password/computer">escape.wolfie.dev/password/computer</a>
      into the URL bar.
      </p>
      <p>Goodluck! And be careful, things aren't always what they seem to be.
